Mamma is a C Unit Test library.

What does it mean ?
===================
Mamma in Italian means mom. But why mamma? Because a good mom looks over her
children behavior, so the unit-test looks over our code behavior.

Why are you developing it ?
===========================
The short answer is: one night I was bored :)
I was using some other minimal C Unit Test environment and as a user I never had
a problem. I wrote my own because it is always funny to do something by yourself
and because when I tried to modified some other framework I was not really
comfortable with the code: too complex sometimes for what it gives you.

Complexity does mean anything, we all have our own criteria. Any way, I will try
to Keep It Simple Stupid :)
